# FinanceTool-Translated
A translation from Gabriel Bittencourts' Finance Tool
Tool for viewing the history and evolution of your club's finances in Dugout-Online

## Installation
1. install [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your browser
2. [Click here]() and click on Install on the next page
3. Open [Dugout](https://dugout-online.com/) and go to the finance page 

### Remarks
- Data is collected daily when you log into Dugout, and saved in your own browser (nothing is sent over the net). If you log into another browser, clear your browsing data or access from an anonymous tab you will not be able to see your previously saved data;
- For premium accounts the collected data is synchronized between your browsers (that this extension is installed on) using the notepad in the game itself (so only for premium accounts). It is possible to disable this feature;
- Projections are made with 4 parameters: daily sponsorships, home tickets, friendly tickets and monday expenses. As the season goes on, the projection is likely to get more accurate due to stabilization of ticket averages, filling of sponsorship slots, etc;
- The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/gabrielbitencourt/do-finance-tools)
